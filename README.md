# typescript

These are the old versions of every single new function, each will have a new version as well.

These functions are free to use without attribution.

They are written in typescript, so run `tsc <filename>.ts` to compile it to javascript, or use the typescript version in your web application.

These are all self contained, and are customizable by default.
